* Maybe we should let the db handle state?
	- shown works as now
	- max is a query
	- filtered is as now except using limited random query
	- if fail to find unshown image, pick the first
* Need to put togther a directory with new images.
	- dektop wallpaper
	- might be able to download straight from google search
	  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22866579/download-images-with-google-custom-search-api
	- http://api.imgur.com/

* Is extending the timer when a UI change is made actually working?
* Look at some other apps:
	- http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/download-collection-of-1000-widescreen.html has a list
* Trash should update the db
	- also if we try a file and it is missing
* Showing great victoria images is fubar:
	- doesn't recycle (just beeps at 5 of 9)
* Maybe on updates we should just do a new query?
	- crazy to do a full query
	- maybe a partial query?
* If uncategorized and rating or scaling is changed then set tags to none
* Get Next and Previous menu items working
* Scaling popup should say how much Max actually is
* Don't think selectNewTag updates main menu
* Get Interval submenu working
* Seems to be a bit of a race when changing a setting and timer firing
	- new image doesn't appear
* Should disable UI window while scanning.
* Support other images menu items.
* Indicate dupes somehow.
	- maybe show in finder could show them both
* Need to watch the directory:
	- need to special case trashFile
	- or maybe just handle it as part of watching
* May want a preference to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* May want a pref for rating scaling.
* Compact database is awfully fast. Maybe it should just be run every hour.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Quit if lose the monitor.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Add some sort of auto update support.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
