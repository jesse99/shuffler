* Nothing happened when double clicking a nib file.

* Get basics working:
	- pick another
	- support hotkeys
	- make sure the animation is working
* Add a UI to control stuff
* Add database support
* Support ratings
* Support tags
	- use sqlite?
	- would be nice if could somehow edit these
	- always have a none
	- default to missing
	- always show missing (or maybe just treat this like everything else and default to selecting missing)
* Support scaling
* May want an option to shift the picture a bit.
* Support trashing
* Indicate dupes somehow.
* Support opening
* Need an icon
* Preference for which directory to use.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Need a preference to blacklist part of a monitor.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help.
* Should have a Get Info command. Probably for the database as a whole.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
