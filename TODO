* Work on filtering:
	- use a thread (and a new db instance) to save uncategorized files
	- be sure to time this
	- may want to set the UI window title
	- shuffle results and start at index 0
	- make sure this much works
	- need to disable next and such if we have no paths yet
	- also need to disable UI if no paths were found
	- use a thread (and a new db instance) to query indexing
		tags are AND, escept for None and Uncategorized which are OR
	- maybe can use a different checkmark for None and Uncaegorized
	- query also needs to handle uncategorized
	- use a weight, drop it according to rating, use the image where it goes to zero, use a factor of 5
	- be sure hash changing at a path is properly handled
* Seems to be a bit of a race when changing a setting and timer firing
	- new image doesn't appear
* Get Next and Previous menu items working
* Get Interval submenu working
* Scaling popup should say how much Max actuall is
* Do we need the ImagePaths table?
	- probably useful when dealing with dupes
* May want a menu item to not show missing
* May want an option to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Support trashing
* Support other file menu items
* Support other images menu items.
* Indicate dupes somehow.
	- maybe show in finder could show them both
* Support opening
* Need to watch the directory
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Should have a Get Info command. Probably for the database as a whole.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
