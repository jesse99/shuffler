* Do a commit
* Get Next and Previous menu items working
* Scaling popup should say how much Max actually is
* Don't think selectNewTag updates main menu
* Get Interval submenu working
* Seems to be a bit of a race when changing a setting and timer firing
	- new image doesn't appear
* Should disable UI window while scanning.
* Support other images menu items.

	- maybe show in finder could show them both
* Need to watch the directory:
	- need to special case trashFile
	- or maybe just handle it as part of watching
* May want an option to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* May want a pref for rating scaling.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Quit if lose the monitor.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Should have a Get Info command. Probably for the database as a whole.
* Add some sort of auto update support.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
