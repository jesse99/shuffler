9.155	NORMAL	found 43684 images in 8.9s

* Support trashing
* Add a tag for Victoria
	- may want to support the Newâ€¦ menu item in the tags menu.
* Preferentially show better rated images:
	- delegate needs a history
	- files should randomly pick a file (no need to shuffle)
	- then step until weight goes to zero
	- uncategorized should have max weight, 5*5*5*5
* Would be nice if great and uncategorized played better together
* Work on filtering:
	- be sure hash changing at a path is properly handled
* Desktop icons aren't showing up
* Prune filtered when tags change
	- may want to test to see if the new tags are inapplicable
* Seems to be a bit of a race when changing a setting and timer firing
	- new image doesn't appear
* Get Next and Previous menu items working
* Get Interval submenu working
* Scaling popup should say how much Max actually is
* Support other file menu items
* Support other images menu items.
* Indicate dupes somehow.
	- maybe show in finder could show them both
* Support opening
* Need to watch the directory:
	- need to special case trashFile
	- or maybe just handle it as part of watching
* May want an option to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* May want a pref for rating scaling.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Quit if lose the monitor.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Should have a Get Info command. Probably for the database as a whole.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
