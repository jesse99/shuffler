* Get Next and Previous menu items working
* Get Interval submenu working
* Get show only rating working
* Get show only tags working
* Add database support
	- when the UI changes a setting write it out into the database
	   maybe do this inside UIWindowController
	- when changing images read settings from the database
	- probably want to ignore database tags that the user isn't using atm
	- hash at a path can change
	  maybe also store size
* Get filtering working:
	- support filtering by tags
		` for now always show missing
	- support rating
* Scaling popup should say how much Max actuall is
* Do we need the ImagePaths table?
	- probably useful when dealing with dupes
* May want a menu item to not show missing
* May want an option to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Support trashing
* Support other file menu items
* Support other images menu items.
* Indicate dupes somehow.
	- maybe show in finder could show them both
* Support opening
* Need an icon
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Should have a Get Info command. Probably for the database as a whole.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
