sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
pod install
open shuffler.xcworkspace
	be sure to build this before trying to build the real shuffler



* Would be nice if Scanning said what it was scanning.
* Got another image that didn't have a hash:
	- multiple paths?
* Punt on imgur.
* Should we have sources instead of stores?
* Work on a databases menu:
	- selecting should create a new store object
	- need a pref for which store is selected
	- support multiple albums
	- probably should support multiple local directories
	- should tags belong to the store?
* Install AFNetworking and ImgurSession:
	- cache images
	- maybe we should allow multiple albums
* Support imgur galleries:
	- update readme with cocopods details
	- trash should be a blacklist
	- maybe open can goto the URL for the image?
	- copy could copy the URL
	- may want a move to <some directory> menu item
	- probably want a Database menu to allow for selecting predefined directories and galleries
Add some more imgur stores:
	- wallpapers
	- cats
	- nature
* flickr?
* Get back on master branch
* Don't think the max code is correct for horz scaling
* Look at supporing networked images:
	- http://api.imgur.com/
	- might be able to download straight from google search
	  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22866579/download-images-with-google-custom-search-api
	- http://melloristudio.com/wallch/1000-HD-Wallpapers
	- http://www.vladstudio.com/wallpaperclocks/browse.php
* Look at some other apps:
	- http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/download-collection-of-1000-widescreen.html has a list
* Indicate dupes somehow.
	- maybe show in finder could show them both
	- or option could show all/trash all
* May want a preference to shift the picture a bit (put this in a menu?)
* Probably want to support margins on all sides
* Preference for which directory to use.
* Need to be able to remove tags.
* Seems to be a bit of a race when changing a setting and timer firing
	- new image doesn't appear
* May want a pref for rating scaling.
* Compact database is awfully fast. Maybe it should just be run every hour.
* Get legit with commercial imgur use:
	- maybe switch to http://unirest.io/objective-c
* Default to user's pictures directory.
	- If that's empty could default to a shuffler directory with a few pics (have to make sure that they are not copy righted)
	- maybe some wiki commons pictures
* Should we use transactions?
* Preference for which monitor to use.
* Quit if lose the monitor.
* Add a license. Maybe not MIT.
* Some sort of help. Maybe quickstart that pops up first time.
	` quickstart should mention where to find the file
	` quickstart should talk about missing tags
* Handle new files appearing.
* Need a better about box.
* Add some sort of auto update support.
* Should we support a way to organize files by tag?
	- old-shuffler has some ideas about this
* Can we get files from a remote source?
* Should disable UI while scanning.

* Probably should persist shown paths in the database:
	- on quit clear the old table and add rows for the shown paths
	- on startup initialize shown from the table
